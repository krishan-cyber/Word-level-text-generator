# Word-level-text-generator

As large language model booming now a days.<br>
i tried to create word level text generator.<br>
It helps to give high level understanding of llm's and natural language processing.<br>
## Approach<br>
Data has been proecessed.Tokenized using already existing excellent libraries.<br>

Processed sentences are converted into sequences for easy feeding into deep learning model.<br>

extra padding is done to ensure working of model.<br>

model is created using tensorflow and keras.I used lstm for their excellent clutch on sequences.<br>

finally model prediction are done.<br>

## future devlopment

currently working on character level text generator and further attention based mechanism for easy eloboration of transformer technology,heart of gpt's like chatgpt,gemini,midjourney etc.
